I've been fiddling with computers since the mid 80s, beginning with a [Sinclair Spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum).
During the final year of my engineering degree, I worked on a [Finite Element Solver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method), which had me well and truly hooked.

I spent 3 and a half years at i2 Technologies, working on supply chain management software. I've been at ThoughtWorks for a little over 11 years now.

I tend to favour a minimalistic approach to building systems: less is more!

## My areas of interest

* Distributed systems in general
* Functional languages (Clojure and Erlang, for the moment)
* Graph databases and other NoSQL stores
* Wrestling with legacy systems
